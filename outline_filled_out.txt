Numstore
  What is Numstore?
    - Solves the problem: "Dense data composed of atomic / structured types"
  Usecases
    - Machine Learning 
      - Array data is already in the shape of tensor 
    - Signal Processing
      - MGHz comparison with various consumer electronics and growing
    - Statistics
      - Math layer on top
    - Embedded
      - Single threaded but still concurrent (with support for multi threaded)
      - Simple Bytes protocol
  Metrics / Numbers 
    - Timing tests (compare with SQL)
      - Read performance
      - Write performance

  Getting Started

    Main Concepts

  Vocabulary
    Variable
      - A "Variable" is just a 
    Type
    Array

  Types
    Primitive
    Struct
    Union
    Enum
    Array

  Operation Codes
    - Numstore's language is easy to understand. It consists of a list of operation codes:
      - Create - create a new variable
      - Delete - delete a variable
      - Insert - insert some data in the middle of an array
      - Remove - Remove data from an array
      - Append - Append data to the end of array (the same as insert at the end)
      - Take - Remove data and read the data you just removed at the same time
      - Update - Overwrite data in an array
    Create
    Delete
    Insert
    Remove
    Append
    Take
    Update

  Configuration
    Variable Level
      - Windowed
        - A windowed variable will have a maximum number of elements. Any time you insert data
    System Level 
      - System level configuration is compile time. Numstore's philosophy is to treat configuration at
        compile time because it's so simple to compile and that aids in the ability to. This might change
        - Number of threads 
        - Page size
        - Memory limits
          - Total maximum memory usage
          - Maximum buffer pool size

  Interfaces
    Command Line Interface (CLI)
    TCP
